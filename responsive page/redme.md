we have a simple responsive webpage structure with a header, navigation, main section, and a footer.
The CSS is used to define the basic layout and styles, 
including making it responsive with percentage-based widths and a max-width for larger screens. 
The viewport meta tag in the head section is crucial for ensuring proper responsiveness on different devices.
You can further enhance the responsiveness by adding media queries in the CSS to apply specific styles based on different screen sizes. 
You may also include JavaScript for more advanced functionalities such as interactive elements or dynamic content.
