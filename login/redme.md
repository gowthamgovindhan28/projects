Overview:
The login form is a basic user authentication interface designed using HTML and styled with CSS. It allows users to input their username and password for authentication purposes.

HTML Structure:

Form Container: The <div> element with the class "login-container" acts as the container for the entire login form.
Header: The <h2> element within the form container provides the title "Login" for the login form.
Form Element: The <form> element encapsulates the input fields and the submit button.
Username Input Field: The <input> element of type "text" serves as the field for users to input their username. It has the attribute "required" to ensure that the field must be filled before submitting the form.
Password Input Field: The <input> element of type "password" allows users to input their password. Like the username field, it has the "required" attribute to ensure its completion before form submission.
Submit Button: The <input> element of type "submit" acts as the button that users click to submit their login information.


CSS Styling:

Form Styling: The "login-container" class applies styling to the form, setting its width, padding, and border.
Input Field Styling: The input[type="text"] and input[type="password"] selectors set the width, padding, and margin for the username and password input fields, making them visually consistent.
Button Styling: The input[type="submit"] selector styles the submit button, setting its width, padding, background color, border, and border radius. The :hover pseudo-class is used to apply a hover effect to the button, enhancing the user experience.


Usage:
To use the login form, embed the provided HTML code within the body of an HTML file. Customize the form's appearance and behavior by modifying the CSS styles according to your design preferences. Integrate the form with a backend authentication system to enable user login functionality.
