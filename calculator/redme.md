HTML:

Create a simple structure for the calculator, including buttons for numbers, operators, and an input or display area to show the results.
Use <div> tags to define the layout and structure of the calculator interface.


CSS:

Style the HTML elements to create an attractive and user-friendly interface for the calculator.
Use CSS to customize the appearance of buttons, input/display area, and overall layout.


JavaScript:
