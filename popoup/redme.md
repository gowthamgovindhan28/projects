Creating a simple popup notification using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript involves creating the structure of the popup in HTML, 
styling it with CSS, and adding functionality with JavaScript.
we first define the popup and overlay styles in the CSS section. The popup is hidden by default, and 
clicking the "Open Popup" button triggers the JavaScript functions to display the popup and overlay. 
Clicking the "Close" button or clicking anywhere on the overlay will hide the popup and overlay.
